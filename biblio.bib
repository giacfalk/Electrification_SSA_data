	abstract = {Successful climate change mitigation will involve not only technological innovation, but also innovation in how we understand the societal and individual behaviors that shape the demand for energy services. Traditionally, individual energy behaviors have been described as a function of utility optimization and behavioral economics, with price restructuring as the dominant policy lever. Previous research at the macro‐level has identified economic activity, power generation and technology, and economic role as significant factors that shape energy use. However, most demand models lack basic contextual information on how dominant social phenomenon, the changing demographics of cities, and the sociocultural setting within which people operate, affect energy decisions and use patterns. Here we use high‐quality Suomi‐NPP VIIRS nighttime environmental products to: (1) observe aggregate human behavior through variations in energy service demand patterns during the Christmas and New Year's season and the Holy Month of Ramadan and (2) demonstrate that patterns in energy behaviors closely track sociocultural boundaries at the country, city, and district level. These findings indicate that energy decision making and demand is a sociocultural process as well as an economic process, often involving a combination of individual price‐based incentives and societal‐level factors. While nighttime satellite imagery has been used to map regional energy infrastructure distribution, tracking daily dynamic lighting demand at three major scales of urbanization is novel. This methodology can enrich research on the relative importance of drivers of energy demand and conservation behaviors at fine scales. Our initial results demonstrate the importance of seating energy demand frameworks in a social context., 
Science‐quality VIIRS night‐sky products can capture short‐term changes in energy service demandWe explore the influence of cultural, socioeconomic, and geopolitical groupings on energy use patternsWe conclude that energy decision‐making and demand is both an individual and sociocultural process},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of nighttime lights has been shown as a good surrogate for estimating population and economic activity at national and sub-national scales, using DMSP satellites. However, few studies have examined the factors explaining differences in nighttime brightness of cities at a global scale. In this study, we derived quantitative estimates of nighttime lights with the new VIIRS sensor onboard the Suomi NPP satellite in January 2014 and in July 2014, with two variables: mean brightness and percent lit area. We performed a global analysis of all densely populated areas (n=4153, mostly corresponding to metropolitan areas), which we defined using high spatial resolution Landscan population data. National GDP per capita was better in explaining nighttime brightness levels (0.60{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.70) than GDP density at a spatial resolution of 0.25° (0.25{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.43), or than a city-level measure of GDP per capita (in proportion to each city's fraction of the national population; 0.49{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.62). We found that in addition to GDP per capita, the nighttime brightness of densely populated areas was positively correlated with MODIS derived percent urban area (0.46{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.60), the density of the road network (0.51{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.67), and with latitude (0.31{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.42) at p{\textless}0.001. NDVI values (representing vegetation cover) were found to be negatively correlated with cities' brightness in winter time (−0.48{\textless}Rs{\textless}−0.22), whereas snow cover (enhancing artificial light reflectance) was found to be positively correlated with cities' brightness in winter time (0.17{\textless}Rs{\textless}0.35). Overall, the generalized linear model we built was able to explain {\textgreater}45\% of the variability in cities' nighttime brightness, when both physical and socio-economic variables were included. Within the generalized linear model, the percent of national GDP derived from income (rents) from natural gas and oil, was also found as one of the statistically significant variables. Our findings show that cities' nighttime brightness can change with the seasons as a function of vegetation and snow cover, two variables affecting surface albedo. Explaining cities' nighttime brightness is therefore affected not only by country level factors (such as GDP), but also by the built environment and by climatic factors.},

Emergy is a measure of the solar energy equivalent used, directly or indirectly, to support the processes that characterize the economic activity in a country. Emergy has renewable and non-renewable components. Our results show that the non-renewable component of national emergy use is positively correlated with night-time satellite imagery. This relationship can be used to produce emergy density maps which enable the incorporation of spatially explicit representations of emergy in geographic information systems. The region of Abruzzo (Italy) is used to demonstrate this relationship as a spatially disaggregate case. © 2013, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Electric power consumption (EPC) is one of the basic indices for evaluating electric power use. Obtaining timely and accurate data on the spatiotemporal dynamics of EPC is crucial for understanding and practical deployment of electric power resources. In this study, an EPC model was developed using stable nighttime lights time-series data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS). The model was used to reconstruct the spatial patterns of EPC in Chinese Mainland at the county level from 1995 to 2008. In addition, the spatiotemporal dynamics of EPC were analyzed, and the following conclusions were drawn. (1) The EPC model reliably represented the spatiotemporal dynamics of EPC in Chinese Mainland with approximately 70\% accuracy. (2) The EPC in most regions of Chinese Mainland was at low to moderate levels, with marked temporal and spatial variations; of high-level EPC, 58.26\% was concentrated in eastern China. Six urban agglomerations (Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region, Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou region, Pearl River Delta, Shandong Peninsula, middle-south of Liaoning Province, and Sichuan Basin) accounted for 10.69\% of the total area of Chinese Mainland but consumed 39.23\% of the electricity. (3) The EPC of most regions in Chinese Mainland increased from 1995 to 2008, and 64\% of the mainland area showed a significant increase in EPC. Moderate increases in EPC were found in 61.62\% of eastern China and 80.65\% of central China from 1995 to 2008, whereas 75.69\% of western China showed no significant increase in EPC. Meanwhile, 77.27\%, 89.35\%, and 66.72\% of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou region, Pearl River Delta, and Shandong Peninsula, respectively, showed high-speed increases in EPC. Moderate increases in EPC occurred in 71.12\% and 72.13\% of the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region and middle-south of Liaoning Province, respectively, while no significant increase occurred in 56.34\% of the Sichuan Basin. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Energy is at the forefront of the
            development agenda. Recognizing energy's vital role in
            development and prosperity, the world has committed to
            Sustainable Development Goal 7 to "Ensure access to
            affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for
            all" as one of 17 goals for 2030, as well as to
            dramatically increase energy efficiency and the use of
            renewable energy. The historic climate change agreement in
            Paris in 2015 also draws attention to the essential scale-up
            of clean energy to attain a 2 degrees C world, with energy
            featuring prominently in many countries' Nationally
            Determined Contributions. Achieving these global energy
            goals calls for more than a trillion dollars of investment
            annually.  Reaching the 2030 targets set by Sustainable
            Energy for All (SEforALL) - universal access to electricity
            and clean cooking fuels, doubling the rate of improvement of
            energy efficiency, and doubling the share of renewable
            energy - requires an unprecedented scale-up of both public
            and private finance. Investment in sustainable energy is
            affected by many factors, including market size, country
            risk, and financial markets, to name but a few. But a
            country's policies and regulations also matter, and
            they are directly under the control of government. This
            report—based on a new and comprehensive global policy
            scorecard called Regulatory Indicators for Sustainable
            Energy (RISE) - answers two important questions. Are
            policymakers around the world truly rising to the challenge
            posed by the new global sustainable energy agenda? Where is
            further action most critically needed?},

This is a particularly salient issue for firms in developing countries, where electricity provision is still unreliable and self-generation is costly. This paper analyzes the impact of electricity provision on productivity, instrumenting for electricity demand with district level solar irradiance for the population of industrial firms in Indonesia.  Results are consistent with general-purpose technology adoption; firms exhibit decreasing productivity in the initial stages of electricity provision and this reductive effect decreases over time. Furthermore, results show that electricity unreliability negatively impacts productivity initially and over time, and this effect is larger for smaller firms.},

	abstract = {Poverty and lack of access to electricity are highly correlated. In Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the poorest regions in the world, two in every three people have no access to electricity. This paper describes a purpose designed model to explore and project the development in the Sub-Saharan African electricity sector in Baseline and Universal access scenarios. The results provide insight into the role of different systems and technologies in providing access to electricity in the region and associated investment requirements. We project that Baseline developments do not lead to universal access to electricity, especially in Eastern Africa and the rural areas. The results show that central grid extension should be complemented with off-grid systems (mini-grid and stand-alone) to increase access in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, the targeted level of consumption has large implications on the preferred electrification technology and associated investment requirements. For low levels of consumption, off-grid technologies are the most important technologies to increase access rate, while for high levels of consumption, extending the central grid is more economical. Total cumulative investment in the period 2010-2030 amount to 22 billion USD for low levels of consumption and exceed 2.5 trillion USD for high levels of consumption.},

	abstract = {We report on the first systematic ground-based validation of the US Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) night lights imagery to detect rural electrification in the developing world. Drawing upon a unique survey of villages in Senegal and Mali, this study compares night-time light output from the DMSP-OLS against ground-based survey data on electricity use in 232 electrified villages and additional administrative data on 899 unelectrified villages. The analysis reveals that electrified villages are consistently brighter than unelectrified villages across annual composites, monthly composites, and a time series of nightly imagery. Electrified villages appear brighter because of the presence of streetlights, and brighter villages tend to have more streetlights. By contrast, the correlation of light output with household electricity use and access is low. We further demonstrate that a detection algorithm using data on night-time light output and the geographic location of settlements can accurately classify electrified villages. This research highlights the potential to use night lights imagery for the planning and monitoring of ongoing efforts to connect the 1.4 billion people who lack electricity around the world.},
